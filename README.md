Exploratory data analysis of an online retail database using Python
## Objective:
The objective of this project is to explore retail data, gather basic information, and gain initial insights into the retail landscape. The exploration includes analyzing the most sold products, understanding customer behavior, and examining sales trends over time.

## Approach:
1. **Data Transformation and Cleaning:** Initially, the focus is on data transformation and cleaning. This involves steps like taking absolute values, creating new variables such as total sales, dropping missing values, and changing variable formats to ensure data consistency.

2. **Data Visualization:** Next, data visualization techniques are employed to gain a better understanding of various variables and their interactions. Visualization helps in exploring the distribution of variables, identifying patterns, and uncovering insights from the data.

## Conclusion:
Through this exploratory process, valuable insights are uncovered, setting the stage for further analysis. Potential areas for future exploration include sales prediction, in-depth analysis of specific variables such as cancellations and fraud, and studying the impact of different scenarios on the dependent variable.

This project demonstrates proficiency in data transformation, exploration, and visualization using Python. It lays the foundation for future projects that delve deeper into specific aspects of retail data analysis.
